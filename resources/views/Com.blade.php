 There are an abundance of hotel recommendation system available on the Internet
such as Trivago, Trip Advisor and Expedia. For rental house, it is very difficult to find
the same recommendation system and usually the owner not advertise their house on
Internet but, promote it to the resident. Problem arise when it is hard to find the nearby
house rental with the University. Usually, the student will go out and ask for the
resident. It will take so much time for student to find their shelter for the whole
semester. To solve this problem, we need a platform that will help student to find the
house. The owner also can promote their house on the platform as it can attract the
student. The system will find the nearby house rental that available and it will make
comparison with other house for the student to make their choice according to the
features requirement.
